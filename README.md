My very first Rails application for the Nashville Software School; its purpose is as an exercise to learn Rails.

This is a standard rails app. To set up the database, run rake db:migrate. To run the app, use `rails s`.

1. User should be able to enter and view a list of tasks.
2. User should be able to mark tasks as completed.
3. User should be able to maintain multiple lists.
